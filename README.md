## Project Title
Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Optimization


## Project Overview
This project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to transition marketing strategies from generalized outreach to highly targeted, data-driven campaigns. The analysis is split into two core objectives: identifying hidden customer segments through unsupervised clustering, and building predictive classification models to determine a customer’s likelihood to accept future promotions. Ultimately, this approach empowers the business to allocate marketing spend efficiently, maximize campaign ROI, and engage the right customers with the right offers.

## Business Problem
The company currently applies broad, non-personalized marketing campaigns across its entire customer base. This leads to:

- Inefficient marketing spend
    * Utilizing a generalized strategy increases marketing spend by wasting budget on demographic segments with a near-zero probability of conversion
- Low campaign conversion rates
    * One-size-fits-all approaches for campaigns results in ignored promotions and stagnant sales throughput, despite high-volume outreach
- Poor differentiation between high-value and low-value customers
    * Without customer segmentation, customers who are highly profitable are treated the same as one-off buyers, thus leaving revenue streams open to competitor offers 
- Missed upselling and retention opportunities
    * High-probability cross-sell opportunities are missed and instead the company waits for customers to churn before trying to save them

There is a critical need for data-driven segmentation and predictive modeling to understand customer behavior, anticipate their actions, and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Stakeholders
The primary audience is:
- Marketing Managers
    * Customer segmentation will allow marketing managers to know who their most profitable customers are and how to reach them efficiently with ads tailored to their purchasing habits
- CRM / Customer Experience Teams
    * Loyalty programs and automated emails with tailored campaigns can be developed to decrease recency and build re-engagement where needed
- Business Strategy Executives
    * Overall company business strategies can be driven based on customer purchasing behaviour
- Sales Leadership
    * Insights into where customers make purchases can guide where investments can be made to increase sales - ex. store expansions vs e-commerce infrastructure 

Secondary audience:
- Data team / Analytics team (for implementation)
    * Results from clustering and the models created can be used to update other tools used by the company as required (ex. Salesforce), modify to process larger datasets, or retrain the model when new data is available

## Business Objective
To leverage customer segmentation for targeted marketing, enhancing campaign effectiveness and driving long-term retention and revenue growth.

The primary project goals are to:
- Identify distinct customer clusters based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement metrics to drive tailored marketing initiatives.
- Enhance marketing targeting strategies by leveraging insights from customer lifetime value (CLV) and satisfaction levels, ensuring personalized communication that resonates with each segment.
- Increase campaign effectiveness and ROI through data-driven segmentation, allowing for precise resource allocation and optimized marketing spend.
- Support long-term customer retention and revenue growth by developing strategies that cater to customer needs and preferences, informed by real-time data and macro-economic conditions.

**Success is measured through cluster interpretability, internal validation metrics, and business applicability, ensuring actionable insights that guide decision-making and foster alignment among stakeholders.**

## Risks and Unknowns
### Risks
**1. Poor Cluster Interpretability:** Clusters may not be clearly distinct or actionable.

>Mitigation plan: Use validation metrics, limit cluster count, perform clear profiling, and validate with business stakeholders. Integrate visualization techniques to intuitively show cluster separations to stakeholders.

**2. Data Quality Issues:** Missing income values, outliers (extreme spending), and/or inaccurate customer demographics.
>Mitigation plan: Clean data systematically (imputation, outlier treatment), conduct EDA, and document preprocessing steps. Employ automated monitoring systems to track data quality and report anomalies in real-time.

**3. Over-Segmentation:** Too many clusters may confuse marketing teams and/or complicate execution.
>Mitigation plan: Select optimal cluster number using statistical methods and align with business execution capacity. Use automated tools to assist in determining the ideal number of clusters (e.g. elbow method).

**4. Static Segmentation:** Customer behavior changes over time.
>Mitigation plan: Retrain models periodically and incorporate recency-based features to capture behavioral changes. Implement dynamic segmentation that adapts to real-time data, ensuring ongoing relevance and accuracy.

**5. External Factors:** Economic downturn, seasonality, product changes may impact behavior, consumer preferences.
>Mitigation plan: Monitor model performance over time and reassess assumptions during economic or seasonal shifts. Users should create contingency plans and flexible strategies based on external factors, ensuring resilience and adaptability.

### Unknowns
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): *Uncertainty regarding the true CLV of segments, impacting marketing priorities.*
- Customer Satisfaction: *Unknown satisfaction levels, influencing retention and campaign effectiveness.*
- Competitor Influence: *Uncertainty about how competitor actions may affect customer behavior.*
- Macro-Economic Conditions: *Potential impact of economic factors on purchasing behavior and marketing success.*
- Variability in Customer Response: *Unclear how different segments will respond to targeted marketing strategies.*

- Resource Availability: *Uncertain levels of resources for implementing targeted strategies.*

# **Project Model**: Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Optimization
## Dataset Description
### Source: [Kaggle – Customer Personality Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis?resource=download)
The dataset contains customer demographic information, purchasing behavior, and campaign response history.
### Shape
- Rows: 2,240 customers
- Columns: 29 variables

Each row represents a unique customer, and each column represents demographic information, purchasing behavior, or campaign interaction history.
