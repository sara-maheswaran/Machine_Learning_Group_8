# Machine_Learning_Group_8

## Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and campaign engagement. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups that enable targeted marketing strategies and improved business decision-making.

## Business Problem
The company currently applies broad, non-personalized marketing campaigns across its entire customer base. This leads to:

- •	Inefficient marketing spend
- •	Low campaign conversion rates
- •	Poor differentiation between high-value and low-value customers
- •	Missed upselling and retention opportunities
